    <h3>About Us (me)</h3>
    <p>This website was made in 08/16/2021 by a 15 year in high school, and this is literally the second thing I have made in HTML, so I hope you can tolerate this... mess? I am not sure, but if you want let me know, I am happy to learn more. My email is right here and it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">example@example.com</a>. I am probloably gonna add some more stuff to this in the future... just for fun.</p>
    <p style="color:white">Since I can be a bit busy, here is my school schedule, it's publically available information, anyways. <a href="Schedule.html">Click Here</a></p>
